        <h2>
          Here is a snippet of Jeff the Orangutan Wizard's incredible life:
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>3400 BC-2000 BC </strong>- Jeff was born in Borneo's dense rain forests. Even as an infant he was seen as a prodigy among his people. At the age of 10, he began his training. His people's elders taught him everything they could.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2000 BC-1500 BC </strong>- After mastering the arts of his people. Jeff sought other great ape species to learn their arts as well. The journey was long and full of challenges. First he visited the Gorilla tribe, deep within the Central Africa's jungles. Here, he mastered the art of taming and riding great beasts called Mokèlé-mbèmbé. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1500 BC-800 BC </strong>- Jeff was a cold, calculating orangutan, not bothered with the suffering around him, only focused on the arts of wizardry. This all changed when he met the Bonobo tribe, south of what is now called the Congo River. Here he learned compassion, gratidude, mercy, beauty and most importantly, love for all things that are alive.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>800 BC-100 AD </strong>- After leaving the Bonobo tribe, he wandered the earth, helping those in need. It is even said that he taught Buddha and Jesus,powerful wizards from the Human tribe, what he learned from the Bonobo tribe, for the mankind reminded him his youth, a time when he did not apprectiated the beauty of life. Alas, he was not successful in his efforts...  
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>100 AD-300 AD </strong>- After his failure, he wandered the earth once again in disillusionment for two centuries, wondering why mankind refused his teachings, why they stubbornly drive towards their doom. Then he found the source of the mankind's spite to itself, a shadow looming over mankind from deep within the western forests of Africa... the Chimpanzee tribe.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>300 AD </strong>- With a rekindled heart for the hope of peace among Great Apes, he approached the Chimpanzee tribe, counselling them not to sow hatred among the mankind, urging them that doing so would doom them as well. But this hateful tribe of the Great Apes did not listen. Their leader Phil the Necromancer, whose heart know nothing but hatred, banished him.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>300 AD-400 AD </strong>- Realizing that the Chimpanzee tribe cannot be convinced in a peaceful manner, Jeff, with a heavy heart, unleashed his destructive magicks that he sworn never to use on any being upon the Chimpanzee tribe. However Phil was a powerful wizard on his own as well as having an iron grip of his tribe which had many other lesser wizards. The War of the Wizards began, lasting for a century. During the war, Jeff shed a single tear for every lesser wizard of the Chimpanzee tribe he destroyed. The tears of Jeff the Wizard formed a lake which is now called the Lake Chad.  
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>401 AD </strong>- The final battle of the War of the Wizards, which is known as the Battle of Bones and Lightning took place on the Western dunes of the Sahara. Phil the Necromancer raised a huge undead army from his fallen subjects and unleashed it upon Jeff. Jeff fought with all his might and managed to destroy the undead army. At the last moment, when Jeff seemed victorious, Phil hurled a ball of pure necromantic energy at Jeff. While Jeff managed to block the necromancer's spell with a lightning bolt of immense energy, it was not enough as the great wizard was already tired due to fighting the massive undead army. A huge explosion occured whose light blinded every living being accross the Western Sahara. In the aftermath there was only Phil, and Jeff seemed to have vanished...
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1942 AD </strong>- In the absence of Jeff, mankind suffered plagues, wars, and famines for a millenium and a half. As this was not enough, Phil orchestraded his magnum opus behind the shadows, The World War II. However, when all seemed lost, Jeff came from out of nowhere, with the power of summoning otters, and hope rekindled once again. A secret war behind the scenes began, the War for the Fate of the Mankind.   
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1945 AD </strong>- With the help of the otters, Jeff obliterated the forces of Phil, cornered him in his secret lair under Mount Kilimanjaro. Once again, Phil raised his fallen subjects to fight his war. However this time, Jeff was prepared. While the otters stalled the undead army, wizards duelled, unleashing their power upon each other with all their might. When the dust settled, Jeff was victorious but broken. He sacrified his life energies in order to make sure that Phil never returned from the dead. With his last breath he urged otters to guide mankind and slipped into the endless sleep without dreams that called death...
